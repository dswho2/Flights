# Team Contract
## Communication
### Team Meetings/Work Sessions
Our team will meet at a minimum of once a week on Saturday 3:00 - 5:00 PM CST via Discord (though accommodations will be made for extraneous cases). During these sessions, we will cover our to-dos, in-progress work, and review our previous week's goals. Afterwards, we will plan out our next week's individual assignments, set some progress goals, and then use the remainder of our time to work collaboratively before disbanding for the week. 

### Assistance/Support
Each team member can be reached through Discord. Outside of extraneous cases, a 36-hour response-time requirement is in place.

### Leadership/Roles
Erik Ji (Lead)
David Ho & Ariocie Liang (Alternating notetakers)

In order to ensure that everyone in the team has equal opportunities to their thoughts and opinions are heard, the lead will be responsible for facilitating safe spaces to share thoughts on our work, during both meetings and during individual work times via Discord.
## Collaboration

### Time Commitment
We have agreed to commit an absolute minimum 4 hours a week of individual work to the project outside of meeting times. However, seeing as all of our schedules are becoming increasingly busier, we may need to facilitate more dedicated collaborative work sessions in order to better maintain our progress towards goals.
### Distribution of Workload
As mentioned before, every week during our meetings, we will designate work to each individual. However, while goals are individual, collaboration is encouraged during both our work sessions and throughout the week through Discord and other means. 

### Code Merging/Continuous Integration Practices
We intend to maintain clear channels of communication and thus code merging should be a heavily collaborative and controlled process to ensure safe and clean merges. Support will be available to assist in code integration and testing.

### Confliction Resolution
Any issues that come up within the team will be resolved by a discussion of the conflicts or qualms and will be resolved by internal negotiation. The team lead will be responsible for treating any interpersonal conflicts as well as technical conflicts by talking it though with their peers during the weekly meetings. Any issues that cannot be solved via basic conflict resolution will be handled on a case-by-case basis.
