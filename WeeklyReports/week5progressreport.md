# Week 5 Progress Report

## Progress
This week BFS algorithm bugs were fixed and A* was started. However, we discovered A* is incompatible with our data and implementation. Therefore, we swapped to Dijkstra's Algorithm and began the implementatinon of that. The map projection was also started this week.

## WW5 -> WW6 Rollover Goals
Finish Dijkstra and map projection and any bugs that we may run into. Additionally, make things look cleaner in general.

## Issues
No new major issues have arisen this week.

## Plan for the next week
1. Finish Dijkstra's and map projection algorithms
