# Week 4 Progress Report

## Progress
This week we completed the basis for our BFS algorithm, though there are some bugs we need to iron out for our full-scale deployment.

## WW4 -> WW5 Rollover Goals
Fix BFS traversal for least stops solving algorithm.

## Issues
No new technical or group issues have arisen this week.

## Plan for the next week
1. Fix BFS Traversal

1. Finish A* heuristic with Euclidean distance for price solving algorithm.

1. Start on map projection algorithm.
