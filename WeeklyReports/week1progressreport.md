# Week 1 Progress Report

## Progress
This week, all of our members were quite packed with work, and thus not much was accomplished. We are still in the data gathering stage, hoping to get more sources of data to get better results with our estimates.

Currently we have found:  
1. [USDOT DB1B Flight Market Dataset](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Tables.asp?QO_VQ=EFI&QO_anzr=Nv4yv0r%FDb4vtv0%FDn0q%FDQr56v0n6v10%FDf748rB%FD%FLQOEO%FM&QO_fu146_anzr=b4vtv0%FDn0q%FDQr56v0n6v10%FDf748rB)
2. [USDOT Domestic Airline Consumer Airfare Report Dataset (Quarterly)](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/domestic-airline-consumer-airfare-report-detailed-fare-information-for-selected-city-pair--118f7)

Although there is also consideration for a live price offering system using [Google Flights API](https://www.google.com/travel/flights) or a related live booking API service, as that provides more relevant data.

## Issues
Some issues we have encountered during our first week include:
* Scheduling issues
* Communication/responsitivity issues
* Lots of work conflict from other classes

We don't think it is anything we have to address immediately, many classes are beginning to wind down.

## Plan for the Next Week
1. Finalize flight datasets
2. Download datasets and begin merging from `.xlsx` and `.csv` to JSON/dictionary-type datatype (key-value pair based).
