# Comments

I have given some minor comments for the leading question, data, algorithms, and timeline.

The major flaw is that you cannot have UI design as your third algorithm as it is not a graph algorithm. If you want, you can have a data visualization as your third algorithm or you can choose any one from the list provided to you. Just keep in mind that you can't have Dijkstra's and A* search as your 2 algorithms and landmarks algorithm doesn't count as uncovered algorithm (only covered).

Another major flaw is that you have not mentioned a traversal in the algorithms section

**Leading question:**

Please elaborate the leading question a bit stating how your algorithm will solve the problem you are trying to solve.

Also, include a question for the second algorithm that you choose in place of UI design.

**Dataset:** 

How will you construct the graph from the datatset? More specifically, what will be the weights on the edges of the graph and how will you get them?

**Algorithms:**

Include a traversal of the graph (BFS or DFS), along with its details like input, output, and time complexity.

Mention the heuristic you will use for A* search.

Think of a third algorithm and include its details like input, output, and time complexity.

**Timeline:**

In the timeline, mention the date (or at least which week) you aim to complete each of the following tasks: data aquisition, data preprocessing, the 3 algorithms (individually), and the final project deliverables.
