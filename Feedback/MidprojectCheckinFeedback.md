# Comments

You have made good progress so far and have finished the data extraction and pre-processing. You have also finsihed writing the bfs algorithm, but you have only tested it out on a small subgraph and not the entire datatset.

I would recommend writing some test cases for the entire graph (if possible, consider some edge case and write test cases to ensure your algorithms work on those edge cases also)
