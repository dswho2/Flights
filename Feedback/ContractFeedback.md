Fixed all issues

Previously - 

Please fix the major issues and flaws mentioned below.

Also, there has to be at least 1 commit from each member of the team which signs this contract. I see only 1 person has commited to the repository and that account is also not an illinois account with the name mentioned, so I'm not sure who has commited and signed.

Please resubmit the contract with the changes and ensure each group member signs it.
